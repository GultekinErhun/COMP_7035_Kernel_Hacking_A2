# COMP_7035_Kernel_Hacking_A2
Implementation of Stanford's 2.2.4* Advanced Scheduler for PintOS — a multilevel feedback queue scheduler (MLFQS).

*-We reference and hyperlink sections of the [Threads chapter of Stanford's Operating Systems](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_2.html) digital textbook, as 2.X.X.

# TODO (rough notes on how to start)
In order to do this assignment, we need to implement priority scheduling sans priority donation (seems to suggest priority inversion is not a problem for MLFQS) as described in [2.2.3](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_2.html#SEC26) before we can start on [2.2.4](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_2.html#SEC27) — the actual assignment. 

## STEP 1: Priority Scheduler

## STEP 2: MFQS (likely will be broken up into more steps)

## STEP N. Post-A2
Sometime around when we hand in this assignment, we need to meet and come up with potential ideas for A3. Semester is really busy, but hopefully we'll be able to do something really, really cool. He said no file system stuff. I will try to come up with some rudimentary ideas in the interim.


# Problem Statement
